# home-to-home-delivery-services
Home-to-Home Delivery Service is a convenient and reliable platform that allows users to request items directly from their relativesâ€™ homes.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

If a user needs food, clothes, medicines, or any item from their relativeâ€™s house, they can simply raise a request through the app/portal.

A delivery boy (parcel boy) will visit the relativeâ€™s house, collect the item, and deliver it safely to the userâ€™s doorstep.
